So, I decided to write this article to share a few resources I have used over the last twenty months of learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails in the hopes it may help others. Also, I am writing to share a little of my story. 

I have always loved web technologies and am self-taught as a hobby. I build my first website with HTML 3.2. I supported many are non-profits for the love of tech, building WordPress sites for years. However, two years ago, something changes, I had a desire to learn more and transition to a professional career. 

In August 2019, I started at [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/) and fell in love with the entire Ruby eco-system: Ruby, Sinatra, and especially [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/). I have a thirst and drive to *be better tomorrow than I am today*, so these resources reflect that desire.

## Free Resources

[Gorails](https://gorails.com/start) - this course, by Chris Oliver of GoRails, creator of [JumpstartPro](https://jumpstartrails.com/?utm_source=gorails) and [Hatchbox](https://hatchbox.io), created this free course for beginners recently. This is a great resource to begin with, to watch, and code along.

[Rails Code Along](https://www.railscodealong.com/) - Steve Polito's course is a little different. This course bridges the gap between building side-projects and a full production application. It follows full Test Driven Development with a Continuous Integration workflow. If you have been coding Rails for a little while, this will really step up for game.

[Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/) - Yes, the Rails Guides. Rails docuemntation is actually quite good. Any sharp developer needs to learn to read the documentation. 

**Other I have not used:**  
[OdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails) - a lot of Rails developers started with Odin Project, I just never have.

[Web-Crunch](https://web-crunch.com/) - Andy Leverenz has a multi-part Rails series that I understand quite good.

## Commercial Resources

[Rails Tutorial](https://www.learnenough.com/) - the Rails Tutorial, by [Michael Hartl](https://twitter.com/mhartl), has been the definitive standard for learning Rails for years. It is on longer free, so it is listed in the Commercial section, but it is worth the cost of admission. Even if you only purchase the Book, it is a great resource. I finished this tutorial while learning Rails at Flatiron, and I am continually referencing the book, or the finished application. It covers User accounts (not Devise), relationship models, and all with TDD using minitest.

[Professional Rails Code Along](https://www.udemy.com/share/101EFgB0UTdV9TRnw=/) - this Udemy course takes a unique approach of mimicking a Professional Production application, designed to meet the clients expectations. It includes an Administration Dashboard to manager users and resources, and full Test Driven Development. Now, the tutorials are dated as they are built with Rails 4.2.6. So, I decided to build with the latest Rails 6.1 and Ruby versions. When I hit a roadblock, I stop, worked through the problems, and documented the results. 

[Ruby on Rails 5 - BDD, RSpec and Capybara](https://www.udemy.com/course/ruby-rails-5-bdd-rspec-capybara/) - a full TDD course by Mashrur Hossain and Emmanuel Asante. Again, a little dated (Rails 5.1), so as before I decided to build with the latest Rails 6.1 and Ruby versions.

[Andrea Fomera](https://store.afomera.dev/) - Andrea's courses are top notch. She has a Rails course that touches on User accounts, relationships, and Javascript rendering. She pre-released a new **Learn Hotwire by Building a Forum** course that I am doing right now that covers reactivity of Hotwire and is excellent.

[Jason Charnes](https://courses.jasoncharnes.com/) - offers a great course called **Interactive Rails with StimulusReflex**
