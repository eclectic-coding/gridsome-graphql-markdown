TLTR: Want to just straight to the code? The complete alias file I use is available in this [GIST](https://gist.github.com/eclectic-coding/7510cf0771cae53f021f938549f027dc).

## Alias possibilities
bash/zsh dotfiles

git config file

## My configuration
I am not going to go over every aliased command in my configuration, just the ones I use most frequently.

**Branches** I have several commands that help with branches.Each command is prefixed with `git`.

- So, to checkout an existing branch: `git co name-of-branch`
- Create a new branch: `git cob name-of-new-branch`
- Create a new branch: `git br name-of-new-branch`. This alias I have stopped using in favor of `cob` because at creation, `cob` changes to the branch.
- Delete a branch: `git brd name-of-new-branch`

**Commits**
So, to check the status: `git st`, which uses the `-sb` switch to trim the CLI to a cleaner output:
```shell script
## master...origin/master
 M content/posts/git-alias-workflow.md
```
- Add all changed files: `git aa` instead of `git add -A`
- Commit:
aa = add -A .
	cm = commit
	aacm = !git add -A . && git commit
	acp = !git add -A . && git commit && git push

**logs**
